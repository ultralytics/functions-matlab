## üìò Description

The [functions-matlab](https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab) repository serves as a centralized store of MATLAB functions. These are the bread-and-butter of our MATLAB codebase, put to use in a plethora of Ultralytics projects. It's designed to promote code reuse and to help maintain consistency across different projects.

## üìã Requirements

To run the resources available in this repository, ensure that you have the following:

- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) version 2018a or higher installed on your system.

üì• **Installation**

Installing and getting started with these functions is a straightforward process:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab
   ```

2. Once cloned, you can add the repository to your MATLAB path to access the functions. Launch MATLAB and run the following command:

   ```matlab
   >> addpath(genpath('path_to_cloned_repo/functions-matlab'))
   ```
   
   Replace `path_to_cloned_repo` with the path to the folder where you cloned the repository.

## üß∞ Usage

To use a function from the repository, simply call it from your MATLAB script or command window as you would with any other MATLAB function. If you have added the repository to your MATLAB path as described above, the functions will be recognized by MATLAB without the need for any additional steps.
