# üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to the Ultralytics MATLAB Functions Repository! This repository serves as a central hub for commonly used functions essential across various Ultralytics projects developed in [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). These scripts provide a foundational toolkit designed to assist in the development and research phases of [machine learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-ml) and [data analysis](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/data-analytics) tasks. Explore and utilize these utilities to streamline your workflow and accelerate your projects!

## üìò What is This Repository?

The [functions-matlab](https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab) repository is a curated collection of MATLAB functions frequently employed within the Ultralytics ecosystem. These functions represent the building blocks used across numerous projects, promoting efficient [code reuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_reuse) and maintaining consistency throughout our MATLAB codebase.

## üìã Requirements

To effectively use the resources provided in this repository, please ensure you have the following installed:

-   [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) version R2018a or newer.

## üì• Installation

Getting started with these functions is straightforward:

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine using [Git](https://git-scm.com/):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab
    ```

2.  Add the cloned repository directory to your MATLAB path. This allows MATLAB to locate and execute the functions. Launch MATLAB and run the following command, replacing `path_to_cloned_repo` with the actual path where you cloned the repository:

    ```matlab
    addpath(genpath('path_to_cloned_repo/functions-matlab'))
    % Example: addpath(genpath('/Users/username/Documents/MATLAB/functions-matlab'))
    ```
    For more details on managing the MATLAB path, see the official [MathWorks documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/addpath.html).

## üß∞ How to Use

Once the repository is added to your MATLAB path, you can call any function directly from your MATLAB scripts or the command window, just like any built-in MATLAB function.

```matlab
% Example: Calling a hypothetical function 'ultralytics_preprocess' from the repository
processedData = ultralytics_preprocess(rawData);
disp('Data processed successfully using Ultralytics function.');
```

Refer to the specific function's documentation (usually included as comments within the `.m` file) for details on its usage, inputs, and outputs. Learn more about [calling functions in MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/learn-matlab/calling-functions.html).
