# Introduction üîç

Welcome to the Ultralytics `functions-matlab` repository! Here, we house a collection of commonly used MATLAB functions that serve as a foundation for various sophisticated machine learning and analytical projects developed at Ultralytics. Explore this repository to enhance and streamline your MATLAB programming tasks with our utility functions.

Visit us at [Ultralytics](http://www.ultralytics.com) for more information.

## What's In This Repository

Ultralytics is dedicated to providing robust and efficient solutions for data analysis and machine learning. In this repository, you'll find well-organized and reusable code snippets that are frequently employed across several of our projects. By leveraging these functions, you can maintain consistency, reduce errors, and save valuable time when working on your MATLAB applications.

# Description üìñ

The [`functions-matlab`](https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab) repository is a go-to resource for Ultralytics-developed common MATLAB functions. These functions are essential building blocks and range from simple utilities to more complex operations commonly encountered in our MATLAB codebases.

Having a centralized repository for these utility functions promotes code reuse and ensures that all our projects benefit from the same level of optimization and rigorous testing.

# Requirements üìã

Before diving into the repository, ensure you have the following requirement:

- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) version 2018a or later.

# Installation and Usage üöÄ

To start using these functions in your MATLAB environment, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab
   ```
2. Add the cloned repository to your MATLAB path:
   ```matlab
   % Replace '/functions-matlab' with the actual path to the cloned repository
   addpath(genpath('/functions-matlab'))
   ```

And that's it! You can now make use of the wide array of functions for your MATLAB projects.
