%replacing 'power' with unity.  This is a linear scaling factor, and the
%whole spectrum is scaled later, so it should be oK.
[Rn_E, xE, rtot] = fcnNukespectrum(n_Ebins,E_min,dE,mass_kt,range,1);%This should return the actual rates, not just the weighting probability function

%Here we have to figure out the fraction of neut. not accounted for by the
%oscillations.

%Ok, here Rn_E is the total number of aneutrino interaction expected.

%this is the total number of a.n. expected from a nuke blast, including oscillations:
NT = 2.25*yield*mass_megatons*(100/range)^2;
%total of Rn_E
%this was done just to the the correction factor for the oscillations.
%the above total includes oscillations.  
tot = sum(Rn_E);
Rn_E = Rn_E/tot;

%procedure:
%Normalize the regular spectrum (add to 1), then divide it by itself, after
%oscillations.  The sum of the UNoscillated spectrum divided by the sum of
%the OSCILLATED spectrum (at 100 km) will give a factor to multiply det_t by 

%This factor turns out to be 1.70150297273881 for a distance of 100km.

scale_d = 1.70150297273881;
Rn_E = Rn_E*NT*scale_d;

%This should give us the correct spectrum for a nuclear explosion at
%distance, withOUT oscillations.  This is total events, with no time
%dependnacy....

return_spec = Rn_E; 

%From the FORTRAN 
%Ro_E is the energy spectrum expected after oscillation
%P_E (osc, here) is the probability of detection due to oscillation
%Rn_E is the original (unoscillated) energy spectrum 
%so Ro_E = osc.* Rn_E

%Ro_E is now an neutrino interactions per day at a spectrum of energies.  
%next step is to assign a temporal decay.  I simply used the graph in 
%figure 9.

%accounting for the smear.  This may be an observational phenomena, which
%may change depending on our event capture method.  It should effect the
%PMT, and any conventional imaging scheme.  Might not be relevant in the
